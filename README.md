# Multipurpose Consolidated Jargon Dictionary

A revised iteration of the MCJD project undertaken for an experiential software course.

The MCJD project takes the entirety of the Government of Canada's linguistic data bank and presents it in a compact, easy-to-use interface that is available for offline use.

What are the uses of the MCJD project?
The MCJD project is a pocket dictionary for your personal computer. Instead of containing common words that can be easily searched online, the MCJD database contains millions of industry jargon and standardized terminology.
